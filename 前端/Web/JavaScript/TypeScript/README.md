# TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is JavaScript with syntax for types.
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.
